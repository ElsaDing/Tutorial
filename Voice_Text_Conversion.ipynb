            " Welcome everyone for the, for my presentation about enabling the circularity of printed flexible packaging and this development of a decision to supporting the designers. First I would like to shortly introduce agenda of today. First we will begin this introduction and research questions followed by the approach and the detailed methodology. Then we go through the results of an discussion and we will conclude with some important take-home messages and also the outlook for the future research. First we might ask how this plastic packaging is managed. We discussed a lot in this conference about the different material flow analysis and so on but in general from policy point of view this is in the European Union countries governed under extended producer responsibility system and there's like a simplified flow shown in the picture in the middle of the slide and then we see the two important stakeholders which are like putting most of the technical part inside the packaging producers and the recyclers. One is to enable the circularity of the classic plastic we are using like the packaging producers. They are supposed to balance in the material like the material performance or the optimistic aspect with respecting the recyclability and of course the recyclers as I was also one like part of them before I do my PhD. We are always very keen now employing like advanced sorting and recycling technology to enable the circularity. So we had a discussion about like what we should do with circulate PET bottle to textile and so on should be circulate the polyol things to the product and chase and so on which is of course for the recycling is a very comfortable way of operation which has been done in past several decades. However we have in this year's European plastic packaging and packaging with regulation came in force and from today like one year later it will be really implication where they have a very ambitious and challenging recycling content for their friends packaging and then we go back to the our packaging waste what are there. In the middle of the slide you see the different recycling code of different materials this is like what we are always talking about but to what not to forget is their physical property and the material composition. I categorize them mainly in three different parts which is the top one is flexible plastic packaging composed mainly low density polyethylene and polypopylene and in the middle this is part which has a multi layer packaging where we have the mixture of different polymers forming barrier and structures. Sometimes we also have some aluminum layers in this and in the last which is the most common one the bottles or the boxes so to speak the rigid packaging which is the most fibres by the recyclers nowadays but what is the composition inside. We see from the right hand side with like the one force of them they are the plastic film and even we have this mixed plastic fraction there is also 30 to 40% of plastic film according to our field sorting analysis on the in the sorting plant which is also published in one of my previous conference papers and you might ask like there is multi layer there is single layer but is there like mostly of them there are multi layers so we anyway can not recycle it which is however the most of the films brought on the market they are just a single layer we can see multi layer is just one one seven so a small part of it however we still have a very low recycling rate about 14% and even lower like a use rate use of recycling rate in the new packaging which is far below the regulation vision from the PBWR therefore we need to increase the quality of the recycling. How does the sorting and recycling technology stand we will have a session later discussing more detail about this this is like my favorite part so in the sorting plants the flexible plastic packaging they are mainly separated by a wind shifter and a ballistic separator from the rigid plastic material according to their physical properties and then there are some in our sorting sorting until according to the different polymer types. In the recycling plant we have different stages of shredding and washing and in the middle we have this intensive washing where we can significantly improve the cleanness of our material before the extrusion and here before the extrusion we have a drying process which is also not can not be ignored because this drying process is not possible to get rid of all the humidity because if you want to get it's really dry then you need to last two or three percent humidity in it a significant increase in your energy consumption so normally in the industrial condition the humidity after drying is always between three to five percent and what are the current limitations in the recycling first we have the magnification they have a paper label on this and the fibers they might have the chance to pass through the different stages and still landing into our recyclables in the polymers as casting already mentioned several times in the conference they have different additives which is of course beyond the capacity of mechanical recycling along the value chain there will be multilayer and also along also impurities as called polymeric cross contamination and last but not least we have our printing ink here which is also a source of contamination and there is several different previous works developing so to speak the inking technology in get rid of the printing ink before the recycling stage and this leads to us also to one first question I'm talking about printing ink for already five minutes or even longer but what is inside in printing ink so the printing ink as we see the nice stereo in between it composed by four different compositions like the largest fraction is binder resin which are also different polymers we have according to our results from the the printing ink experts we have four different polymer ridgings which we have the most common one is nitro cellulose as which is has like 80% of market occupation and the next one for flexotographic application this is also very important to mention the process of printing and then we have the polyurethane which is normally used as printing ink for the multilayer packaging but this is regarded in recent years as recycling a friendly alternative to nitro cellulose printing binder and then we have two different so to speak as co-binder or as overprint vanish what is overprint vanish I will come to this later and then in the end we have the UV cross link acrylics which is mainly for legal application as we saw in the last presentations from my colleague Wagner and then we have the different pigments this is like a very big family of different substances mainly metal complexes as I've shown here the chemical structure of a common blue pigments and also some more easy one like metal oxidants like titanium dioxide this is well known and then we have the organic solvents but this is not relevant for recycling because this already evaporated in the after printing in the packaging production process and in the end we have the different additives to obtain the desired properties of the printing so what we have from all these introductions what are the questions that is relevant so first we don't really aware of the chemical reactions of printing ink under the mechanical recycling process and second if we have this printing ink you might ask are the printing ink is just like a very small part is very thin but how does it affect the quality of the recycled plastics and there might be for in this table I have shown there are different the ink in processes you say oh this is already there but in in the practical experience we already see some of the ink they can be removed some of the ink they cannot but what are their composition and in the last what is the suitable circular economy strategies should be just change the printing ink or should we apply widely at the ink ink process this is the last question I would like to answer and so for this question we this is our general approach first for the chemical reaction because there are already a lot of papers regarding this even not specifically on the printing ink and on recycling a literature review is conducted and in the second steps we had a simulated recycling process to access the impact of printing ink on the recycled quality and in the for the third one we have the inking experiments to see if there is a negative impact can be what can be what can be removed and what can not in the end all these data will be fitted to the last hour decision making tool and to give formal decision of changing the printing ink composition or improving the recycling process so firstly we have the first for the first research question we have this is our approach after the expert interview which the result I have shown already previously and we get some lesser keywords for our literature and after the literature research we selected more than 500 publications and 113 were identified as relevant and included in the literature review and they were sorted by type of substances and their degradation mechanisms and for the second one for the simulated recycling experiments we have these four common printing printer reasons they are compounded with low density polyethylene and we have our experimental group under a simulated industrial recycling process this taking consideration of the rest 3% of humidity and our reference group we have one extrusion without humidity and we have a plant formed with organic solvents followed by drying to isolate the influence from the high temperature and mechanical stress in the extrusion and we have the pure benders as a reference for the analysis first we have the degradation analysis to verify our discovery in the literature review with FTIR and the Somal Gravy Metri analysis the industrial simulated the simulated recycling recycling which is the experimental group will be subjected to material analysis and the result of material analysis forms a single score system called substitute ability factor to give a straightforward impression of the the recycled collected before and afterwards and for that in-capability analysis we with the help of printing in producer we selected the common printing binder printing pigment and the overprint vanish and the different base material and you see here different colors and these colors are like their according color of their of the samples and what is overprint vanish here is a small explanation in the variation A we have the normal we have the base substrate and then we have the printing ink on top and in the next variation we have on the top of the printing ink we have overprint vanish to increase the glossy of the printing ink and also to protect the printing ink and in the variation C we have the base layer in between that is to protect the insert migration if you hear of the PEP before and the LDP they are more easy to migrate and this is to protect the intermigration either from the ink to inside or the content to outside and which is specifically for some kind of food packaging application to evaluate the ink ability we have three different conditions which is the first is the code washing condition because according to the industrial practice if you don't put any heating in your washing plant there will be any way for a degree due to the friction and machinery and so on and then we have also of course a normal hot washing condition and in the middle we also would like to elaborate our FIS possible to reduce even a part of the energy consumption because this study was carried in 2022 and then every while started to be very concerned about energy consumption even this is a really a little part after our calculation in the end then we have four different common printing ink common surface tents which is reported by the literature and here I think this is not up to clay this is not very good in the in the dimmer this is how we evaluate the printing ink the ink rate this is like before we have a full fully covered sample and after the inking process we have developed a computer program to calculate the area of color to to know that the ink in rates and so here we come through the results first the results from the literature review like we have the as we said before the most common printing binder is the nitrous cellos but it's however has a very low thermostebtility and until behind we're 60 degree this is probably the reason why there is a brownish color and so on and the degradation product as we can see from the reaction side this is will be very small molecules like different gas coming dioxide, nitrous oxide, water and so on. The case for the polyurethane printing in binder is a little bit different it is really so most stable until 250 degree however the humidity we mentioned before it is significantly altered the thermostebtility if you have cover made bond if you have Easter bond so there will be degradation whether this is true or not or this is really so sensitive in in the reality we will find out later and here are also some degradation of the like other not very common binders or coal binders and we can see if we have this cover made bond or Easter bond a degradation is possible and then we come to the thermostebtility of the pigments pigments as mentioned before has a very big different variations and here you can see the yellow color side or the left side between 16 and 230 degree which this pigments can have some more degradation but we would like to isolate this unknown risk therefore it is generally suggested to use some color ends same as coloring the plastic itself because the color plastic film there anyway there in the include stream. As for the after our literature review we carried out the second study to verify the result of literature review under our specific recycling environment and for the natural cellulose we can find out like both of them and recycling under dry and wet condition a degradation happens if compared to the pure natural cellulose or the natural cellulose LDPE solvent plant you can see the that's the this pig disappeared and is also confirmed by our thermograwi metric analysis in the right hand part. For the polyurethane this our hypothesis was almost 100% confirmed because we can see the blue one which is extruded under a dry condition it contains all the specific peaks of polyurethane but they all disappeared in the wet extruder plant and this is also confirmed by the dynamic thermograwi metric analysis and we can see the blue parts this they have the same trend as the wet parts and and it's like over lacking with the green line and then the the wet plant has a very similar trend to a vervean LDPE. So and of course what is the impact of the recycled quality for the natural cellulose the recycled metaflow index is actually promoted not by the degradation product itself but is by the by the plasticizer what we found from the GCMS analysis and from the recycled from the mechanical property it is discovered all of them has a lower tensile strings and string at brick and which we can already see the impact on the on the recycled quality and this and here we can see the optic of this of this recyclade from the picture below and we have this straightforward method to evaluate the impact and we can see like if we control the polyurethane content as 1% this is as good as this is as good as a vervean LDPE and the natural cellulose binder is of course much worse therefore we might have this we can might we might conform a conclusion that we just switch to polyurethane then the problem is solved however the scientific work like in our everything in our real life doesn't when so ideal is smooth as we thought therefore we need the next study about the being capability of this of the of the different printing printed plastic samples and we can see from that we imagine there's been there there's pigments of the printing ink and we found out like the nitro cellulose and the polyurethane binder they can be washed off very easily and for PVB binder and UV acrylic it can at the inking is only possible as 70 degree and this also with specific surface tank for pigments there we can see generally there is no influence or minor influence if a complete inkability can be achieved but with partially the inkability the black the current black pigment poses a challenge because of is high high-drophobicity for the absorption on the plastic surface why this is like this PU thing is also easily because there is it doesn't exist in for a single layer of flexographic printing it always have a PVB over print vanish on the top and as we can see if we have such a construction only 70 degree this specific cationic surface tank enables at the inking while for the natural cellulose even you have this like two components which means the cellulose is cross-linked and we can reach at the inking at 70 degree as well but the exception is this specific food component this at the inking is not possible at all but in the previous study we already know that the CAP is anyway a very small content and so the impact on the recycling code is relatively minor therefore this comes to our final question should we do at the inking or should we do our design changing the answer is luckily very clear so we have a field to change the printing design we should use this polarity and the PVB system and limiting the content under 1% or we apply a dinking process at 70 degree with 2% 1 to 2% OH and cationic surface tank then it enables us to have a free choice of printing systems because all of them can have a very high substitutability rate comparable to a very important and much higher above the 0.90 thresholds so the most important take home message of this study is the natural cellulose binder will degrade it in the recycling process but it enables a lot of the inking and the polarity in this printing ink has a high semi-stability yes but the semi-stability will change from the humidity the the inking process at 70 degree and the Eclic condition this cationic surface tank is of course the choice of having different printing inks so all of them will be washed off and this process will slightly increase your energy or energy consumption but it and therefore a little bit more CO2 emission but it will be compensated by the higher substitution capacity of a higher quality recyclate to reduce demand of virgin polymer production and in the end this study of course has some limitations first the attrition force between the printing ink and the substrates substrate is difficult to measure and also the economic aspect should be more investigated therefore we suggest that's the further development of specific printing ink which is called debonding on demand this is already existing in electronic industry like the PCB there are some of them are designed like this maybe there will be also a specific environment like high temperature and high pH which if we don't have in the use phase of the packaging to enable a debonding on demand and also of course we suggest a higher the further development of higher efficient washing equipment as well as surfactant because this surfactant used in the study is only like one component but if you see our recall our previous presentation about the different detergents of washing your face or washing your hair the composition this is very long so this is like absolutely the way for further development and we talk about the iconic factors was not was not at the part of study but this is definitely the worst for the investigation because it can enable the more synergy under the APR system for higher circularity so that's the first list thank you very much and I hope you like it and if you have some questions please feel free to ask\n"
